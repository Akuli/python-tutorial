# Contact me

If you have any trouble with the tutorial or you would like to improve
it, there are a few ways to contact me:

- Create an issue on GitHub.

    This is probably the best choice if you had trouble following the
    tutorial, and something in it should be explained better. Click
    [here](https://github.com/Akuli/python-tutorial/issues/new) to
    create an issue. You will be asked to create a GitHub account if you
    don't already have one.

- Tell me on IRC.

    I'm usually on ##learnpython and ##python-friendly on freenode. See
    [Getting help](getting-help.md) for instructions to getting there.
