#Exercise
### These are some Exercises that will help you learn
#Strings
1. Write  code to count a character from a string without using any built-in methods other than input() and print()
  <br>**Ans)** Refer [This](Strings/character%20count%20without%20methods(using%20for).py)
2. **FIX THE CODE:** The programme must be able to find all the occurances of a sub-string and something prevents it. Refer the Output for more details
 <BR> **Get the code by clicking [Here](Strings/FIX%20THE%20CODE_to%20find%20function%20multiple%20occurance.py)** <BR>
 <U> **OUTPUT**</u>
      > `>>>`Type the string:asasa<BR>
`>>>`Type the character/word you want to find the occurance:asa<BR>
`>>>`The index of the occurance is/are {0, 2} repeating 2 times

    Here as you can see this finds `asa` from `asasa` twice, even though after the first `asa`, 
only `sa` is left and that does not contain another `asa`. 

So,correct the code

3. Write a code to remove the vowels and return a blank space in-place of it in a user given string
   <br>**Ans)** Refer [This](Strings/removing%20vowels%20from%20a%20string.py)
   
4. Simplify the [code](Strings/SIMPLIFY%20THE%20CODE_longest%20substring%20in%20a%20string.py) to get the same result
   (Also optimise the code with better variable names if needed) 
   

#Patterns
1. Make a programme to get a pyramid like shown in the OUTPUT section where user can type the number of rows needed"""
   >**OUTPUT** for 5 rows<br>
1 <br>
1 2 <br>
1 2 3 <br>
1 2 3 4 <br>
1 2 3 4 5 <br>
   
**Ans)** Refer [this](Patterns/1%2012%20123%201234%20pyramid.py)

 2. Make a programme to get a pyramid like shown in the OUTPUT section where user can type the number of rows needed"""
    >**OUTPUT** when rows is equal to 5<br>
1 2 3 4 5 <br>
2 3 4 5 <br>
3 4 5 <br>
4 5 <br>
5 <br>
    
**Ans)** Refer [this](Patterns/1234%20234%2034%204%20pyramid.py)
#Palindrome
1. Check if a number is pallindrome by converting it into a string
   <br>**Ans)** Refer [this](pallindrome/Checking%20if%20a%20number%20is%20a%20pallindrome%20Easy.py)
2. Check if a number is pallindrome by accepting a number from user using int(input("Enter the number"))<br>
**INSTRUCTION:** Do not convert it into a string or to any other format. Only use it as an integer itself
   <br>**Ans)** Refer [this](pallindrome/Checking%20if%20a%20number%20is%20a%20pallindrome%20hard.py)
