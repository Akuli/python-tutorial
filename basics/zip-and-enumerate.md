# zip and enumerate

Now we know how [for loops](loops.md#for-loops) work in Python. But
for loops aren't limited to printing each item in a list, they can
do a lot more.

To be able to understand for loop tricks we need to first know
assigning values to multiple variables at once. It works like this:

```python
>>> a, b = 1, 2
>>> a
1
>>> b
2
>>>
```

We can use `()` and `[]` around these values however we want and
everything will still work the same way. `[]` creates a list, and
`()` creates a tuple.

```python
>>> [a, b] = (1, 2)
>>> a
1
>>> b
2
>>>
```

We can also have `[]` or `()` on one side but not on the other
side.

```python
>>> (a, b) = 1, 2
>>> a
1
>>> b
2
>>>
```

Python created a tuple automatically.

```python
>>> 1, 2
(1, 2)
>>>
```

If we're for looping over a list with pairs of values in it we
could do this:

```python
>>> items = [('a', 1), ('b', 2), ('c', 3)]
>>> for pair in items:
...     a, b = pair
...     print(a, b)
...
a 1
b 2
c 3
>>>
```

Or we can tell the for loop to unpack it for us.

```python
>>> for a, b in items:
...     print(a, b)
...
a 1
b 2
c 3
>>>
```

This feature is often used with Python's built-in `zip()` and `enumerate()` functions.


## zip

What comes to your mind when you hear the word `zip`? A mechanism extensively used to tie two parts of something, e.g. shirt or jacket. Python's `zip()` functions does pretty much the same, it helps us tie corresponding items together.

```python
>>> users = ["Tushar", "Aman", "Anurag", "Sohit"]
>>> uids = ["usr122", "usr123", "usr124", "usr125"]
>>> user_details = zip(uids, users)
>>> print(list(user_details))
[('usr122', 'Tushar'), ('usr123', 'Aman'), ('usr124', 'Anurag'), ('usr125', 'Sohit')]
>>>
```

Note that `print(user_details)` doesn't work as expected:

```
>>> print(user_details)
<zip object at 0x0000016938E311C0>
>>>
```

This is because `zip()` is an iterator, i.e. lazy: it gives the items as needed, instead of calculating them and storing them into memory all at once like a list. So the zip object cannot show its elements before the elements are used, because it hasn't computed them yet.

```python
>>> users = ["Tushar", "Aman", "Anurag", "Sohit"]
>>> uids = ["usr122", "usr123", "usr124", "usr125"]
>>> user_details = zip(uids, users)
```

If the lists are of different lengths, some items from the end of the longer list will be ignored.
```python
>>> users = ["Tushar", "Aman", "Anurag"]
>>> emails = ["tushar@example.com", "aman@example.com", "anurag@example.com", "sohit@example.com"]
>>> users_contact = zip(users, emails)
>>> print(list(users_contact))
[('Tushar', 'tushar@example.com'), ('Aman', 'aman@example.com'), ('Anurag', 'anurag@example.com')]
>>>
```


Here the shortest list is `users`, with length 3, so `zip(users, emails)` only takes the first 3 emails.
We do not recommend calling `zip()` with lists of different lengths, because ignoring items is usually not what you intended to do.

### Using zip in a `for` loop

It is very common to `for` loop over a `zip()`, and unpack the returned tuples in the `for` loop.
This is why we introduced unpacking in the beginning of this page.
When used this way, there's no need to convert the result of `zip(...)` to a list.

```python
>>> roll_nums = [20, 25, 28]
>>> students = ["Joe", "Max", "Michel"]
>>> for roll_num, student in zip(roll_nums, students):
...     print(f"Roll number of {student} is {roll_num}")
...
Roll number of Joe is 20
Roll number of Max is 25
Roll number of Michel is 28
>>>
```

## enumerate

`enumerate()` is an amazing Built-in function offered by python. When used, gives us the index and the item combined.

```python
>>> even_nums = [2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12]
>>> for index, item in enumerate(even_nums):
...     print(f"Index of {item} is {index}")
...
Index of 2 is 0
Index of 4 is 1
Index of 6 is 2
Index of 8 is 3
Index of 10 is 4
Index of 12 is 5
>>>
```

It is also possible (but more difficult) to do this without `enumerate()`:

```python
>>> even_nums = [2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12]
>>> for index in range(0,  len(even_nums)):
...     print(f"Index of {even_nums[index]} is {index}")
...
Index of 2 is 0
Index of 4 is 1
Index of 6 is 2
Index of 8 is 3
Index of 10 is 4
Index of 12 is 5
>>>
```

Here:
* `range(0, len(even_nums))` gives 0,1,2,3,4,5, with the list length 6 excluded. These are the indexes of our list of length 6.
* `even_nums[index]` prints each element of `even_nums`, because `index` comes from the range of all indexes into that list.

Because this is complicated to think about and easy to get wrong, it is better to use `enumerate()`.

## Exercises

1. Create a program that works like this. Here I entered everything
    after the `>` prompt that the program displayed.

    ```
    Enter something, and press Enter without typing anything when you're done.
    >hello there
    >this is a test
    >it seems to work
    >
    Line 1 is: hello there
    Line 2 is: this is a test
    Line 3 is: it seems to work
    ```

2. Create a program that prints all letters from A to Z and a to z
    next to each other:

    ```
    A a
    B b
    C c
    ...
    X x
    Y y
    Z z
    ```

    Start your program like this:

    ```python
    uppercase = 'ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ'
    lowercase = 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'
    ```

    **Hint:** how do strings behave with `zip`? Try it out on the
    `>>>` prompt and see.

3. Can you make it print the indexes also?

    ```
    1 A a
    2 B b
    3 C c
    ...
    24 X x
    25 Y y
    26 Z z
    ```
