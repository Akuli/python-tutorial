# Help and Docstrings

In this tutorial we have used `help()` a few times. It's great and you
can use it as much as you want to. For example, running `help(str)`
displays a nice list of all string methods and explanations of what they
do, and `help(list.extend)` explains what extending something to a list
does.

You can get help of many other things too. For example:

```python
>>> stuff = []
>>> help(stuff.append)
Help on built-in function append:

append(object, /) method of builtins.list instance
    Append object to the end of the list.

>>> help(print)
Help on built-in function print in module builtins:

print(...)
    print(value, ..., sep=' ', end='\n', file=sys.stdout, flush=False)

    Prints the values to a stream, or to sys.stdout by default.
    Optional keyword arguments:
    ...
```

## Docstrings

Let's see what happens if we [define a function](defining-functions.md)
and call `help()` on that.

```python
>>> def thing(stuff):
...     return stuff * 2
...
>>> help(thing)
Help on function thing in module __main__:

thing(stuff)
>>>
```

That sucked! We have no idea about what it does based on this. All we
know is that it takes a `stuff` argument.

This is when documentation strings or docstrings come in. All we need to
do is to add a string to the beginning of our function and it will show
up in `help(the_function)`. Like this:

```python
>>> def thing(stuff):
...     "hello there"
...     return stuff * 2
...
>>> help(thing)
Help on function thing in module __main__:

thing(stuff)
    hello there
```

Note that docstrings are not comments. If you add a `# comment` to the
beginning of the function it won't show up in `help()`.

## Multi-line strings

When we did `help(print)`, we got more than one line of help. Maybe we
could do that in our own docstring too?

```python
>>> def thing():
...     "This thing does stuff.\n\nIt always returns None."
...
>>> help(thing)
Help on function thing in module __main__:

thing()
    This thing does stuff.

    It always returns None.
>>>
```

That's better, but how what if we want to do 5 lines of prints? Our
`"stuff\n\nstuff\nstuff"` thing would be really long and hard to work
with. But Python has multi-line strings too. They work like this:

```python
>>> """bla bla bla
...
... bla bla
... bla bla bla"""
'bla bla bla\n\nbla bla\nbla bla bla'
>>>
```

So we can write documented functions like this:

```python
>>> def thing():
...     """This thing does stuff.
...
...     It always returns None.
...     """
...
>>> help(thing)
Help on function thing in module __main__:

thing()
    This thing does stuff.

    It always returns None.

>>>
```

It's recommended to always use `"""strings like this"""` for docstrings,
even if the docstring is only one line long. This way it's easy to add
more stuff to it later.

## Documenting other stuff

Docstrings aren't actually limited to functions. You can use them for
documenting [classes](classes.md) and their methods too. For example,
let's make a file like this and save it to `test.py`:

```python
"""A test module.

It contains a class and a function.
"""


class Thing:
    """This is a test class."""

    def thingy(self):
        """This is a test method."""
        print("hello")


def do_hello():
    """This is a test function."""
    thing = Thing()
    thing.thingy()
```

Then we can import it and call help on it:

[comment]: # (github screws up syntax highlighting here)

```
>>> import test
>>> help(test)
Help on module testie:

NAME
    testie - A test module.

DESCRIPTION
    It contains a class and a function.

CLASSES
    builtins.object
        Thing

    class Thing(builtins.object)
     |  This is a test class.
     |
     |  Methods defined here:
     |
     |  thingy(self)
     |      This is a test method.
     |
     |  ----------------------------------------------------------------------
     |  Data descriptors defined here:
     |
     |  __dict__
     |      dictionary for instance variables (if defined)
     |
     |  __weakref__
     |      list of weak references to the object (if defined)

FUNCTIONS
    do_hello()
        This is a test function.

FILE
    /home/akuli/testie.py
```

That's pretty cool. We just added docstrings to our code and Python made
this thing out of it.

You might be wondering what `__weakref__` is. You don't need to care
about it, and I think it would be better if `help()` would hide it.

## Popular Docstring Formats

There are different styles for writing docstrings. If you are contributing to
another Python project, make sure to use the same style as rest of that project
is using.

If you are starting a new project, then you can use whichever style you
want, but don't "reinvent the wheel"; use an existing style instead instead of
making up your own. Here are some examples of popular docstring styles to choose
from:

### Sphinx Style

[Sphinx](https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/) is the Python documentation tool
that [the official Python documentation](https://docs.python.org/3/) uses.
By default, sphinx expects you to write docstrings like this:

```python
class Vehicles:
    """
    The Vehicles object contains lots of vehicles.
    :param arg: The arg is used for ...
    :type arg: str
    :ivar arg: This is where we store arg
    :vartype arg: str
    """

    def __init__(self, arg):
        self.arg = arg

    def cars(self, distance, destination):
        """We can't travel a certain distance in vehicles without fuels, so here's the fuels

        :param distance: The amount of distance traveled
        :type amount: int
        :param bool destinationReached: Should the fuels be refilled to cover required distance?
        :raises: :class:`RuntimeError`: Out of fuel

        :returns: A Car mileage
        :rtype: Cars
        """  
        ...
```

### Google Style

Google Style is meant to be easier to read and use without a tool like sphinx.
Sphinx can be configured to use that with
[sphinx.ext.napoleon](https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/usage/extensions/napoleon.html).

```python
class Vehicles:
    """
    The Vehicles object contains lots of vehicles.

    Args:
        arg (str): The arg is used for...

    Attributes:
        arg (str): This is where we store arg.
    """

    def __init__(self, arg):
        self.arg = arg

    def cars(self, distance, destination):
        """We can't travel distance in vehicles without fuels, so here is the fuels

        Args:
            distance (int): The amount of distance traveled
            destination (bool): Should the fuels refilled to cover the distance?

        Raises:
            RuntimeError: Out of fuel

        Returns:
            cars: A car mileage
        """
        ...

```

### Numpy Style

[Numpy](https://numpy.org/) is a large and popular Python library,
and numpy developers have their own docstring style.

```python
class Vehicles:
    """
    The Vehicles object contains lots of vehicles.

    Parameters
    ----------
    arg : str
        The arg is used for ...
    *args
        The variable arguments are used for ...
    **kwargs
        The keyword arguments are used for ...

    Attributes
    ----------
    arg : str
        This is where we store arg.
    """

    def __init__(self, arg):
        self.arg = arg

    def cars(self, distance, destination):
        """We can't travel distance in vehicles without fuels, so here is the fuels

        Parameters
        ----------
        distance : int
            The amount of distance traveled
        destination : bool
            Should the fuels refilled to cover the distance?

        Raises
        ------
        RuntimeError
            Out of fuel

        Returns
        -------
        cars
            A car mileage
        """
        pass
```

## When should we use docstrings?

I recommend using docstrings when writing code that other people will import.
The `help()` function is awesome, so it's good to make sure it's actually helpful.

If your code is not meant to be imported, docstrings are usually a good
idea anyway. Other people reading your code will understand what it's
doing without having to read through all of the code.

## Summary

- `help()` is awesome.
- A `"""triple-quoted string"""` string in the beginning of a function,
  class or file is a docstring. It shows up in `help()`.
- Docstrings are not comments.
- Usually it's a good idea to add docstrings everywhere.
